# Memory Game

Who hasn't played card games at some point? From a very young age to a beer night with friends, right?

Well, for this Challenge you will have to choose your favourite theme and recreate
the [famous game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)).

## How it works?

The requirements for the game are pretty simple. First, you have to choose whatever theme you want to, like
Pok√©mon, Star Wars or even Peppa Pig!

The dynamics of the game will consist of presenting a board with a series of face-down cards and revealing all the pairs
before the time is up. The user will tap on each card to turn it over and, if two of them match when they are uncovered,
they will be turned face up. If not, they will be hidden again.

**The game is won if all pairs are uncovered within the time limit.**

So, the game will have an initial screen to select one of the three difficulties and 1 minute to solve each board:

* Easy: 4x4 board
* Medium: 4x6 board (or 6x4 depending on the screen)
* Difficult: 5x6 board (or 6x5 depending on screen)

The application will have a main game screen that contains the following elements:

* Game board. The board where the user will play and see the cards.
* Move counter. Every time 2 cards are turned over it will increase by 1, whether you hit or not.
* Time counter. A 1-min countdown to reveal all pairs!
* Remaining pairs counter.
* A button to return to the level selection screen.

## Technical requirements

* Create a **clean**, **maintainable** and **well-designed** code. We expect to see a good and clear architecture that
  allows to add or modify the solution without so much troubles.
* **Test** your code until you are comfortable with it. We don't expect a 100% of Code Coverage but some tests that
  helps to have a more stable and confident base code.

To understand how you take decisions during the implementation, **please write a COMMENTS.md** file explaining some of
the most important parts of the application. You would also be able to defend your code through
[Rviewer](https://rviewer.io), once you submit your solution.

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as you
expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
